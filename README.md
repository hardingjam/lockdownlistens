# Lockdown Listens

https://lockdownlistens.herokuapp.com/

## Origins

LL began life as a group chat where around fifty members shared music reccommendations. From ambient weekday mornings, downtempo midweek afternoons and Friday vibes (fribes) worthy of the shuttered venues of our respective cities, its members made sure the music never really stopped.

## Recommendations

This website gathers music recomendations from a year of Lockdown and delivers a selection of treats to suit the moment. 

Upon arrival, users are prompted to enter their timezone. Based on the day of the week and time of day, Lockdown Listens will present mixes from Soundcloud and Mixcloud which, over the course of the last year, our users reccommended for that day and time.

## Rooms

In Rooms, a host provides the music and guests remain in sync and on time. Anything from the archive is available - but if you prefer to bring  your own records you can provide an outside link. 

There is no log-in or registration. Rooms are designed to be simple and streamlined. All you need to join is the name of the room. Once inside, the host's choice of music loads in your browser, and the sync button will scrub your player to the host's timestamp.

## Search

Not everybody  operates on the same schedule - our search function can help you find  something more suited to another day or time. It uses slightly wider parameters than the homepage results, allowing you to explore the catalogue more thoroughly.

## Submit

We invite users to submit to the catalogue, and ask only that they embrace the spirit of situational listening when they do.

## Enjoy

Stay healthy, and happy listening!
