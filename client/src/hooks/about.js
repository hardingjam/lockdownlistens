                    Sumbissions would span ambient weekday mornings, downtempo
                    percussive midweek afternoons and finally Friday vibes
                    (fribes) worthy of the shuttered venues of our respective
                    cities.

                    This website gathers music reccomendations from a year of
                    Lockdown and delivers a selection to suit the moment.

                    We invite users to submit to the catalogue, and ask only
                    that they embrace the spirit of situational listening when
                    they do.

                    Not everybody operates on the same schedule - so our Search
                    function can help you find something more suited to another
                    day or time.
