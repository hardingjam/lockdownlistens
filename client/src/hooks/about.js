                    From ambient weekday mornings, downtempo midweek afternoons
                    and Friday vibes (fribes) worthy of the shuttered venues of
                    our respective cities, its members made sure the music never
                    really stopped.

                    This website gathers music recomendations from a year of
                    Lockdown and delivers a selection of treats to suit the
                    moment.

                    In Rooms, a host provides the music and guests remain in
                    sync and on time. Anything from the archive is available -
                    but if you prefer to bring your own records you can provide
                    an outside link.

                    Not everybody operates on the same schedule - our search
                    function can help you find something more suited to another
                    day or time.

                    We invite users to submit to the catalogue, and ask only
                    that they embrace the spirit of situational listening when
                    they do.
                </p>
